# Model Tree + 3D View

A single-page **TypeScript React** app that lets you build a model hierarchy (tree) and edit it in a **Three.js** viewport. Nodes can be empty groups or primitives (Box, Cylinder, Cone, Sphere). You can reorder via drag-and-drop, select from either the tree or the 3D view, and manipulate transforms with a gizmo.

## Demo (what to try)

- **Add nodes:** Hover a row, click the ‚ûï icon, then pick a primitive or ‚ÄúEmpty‚Äù.
- **Delete nodes:** Hover a row and click the üóë icon to delete a node (and its subtree).
- **Rename nodes:** Select a row and click ‚úèÔ∏è to edit the node name.
- **Reorder nodes:** Drag a row; drop on the **top/bottom** band to move among siblings or on the **middle** to reparent under the target.
- **Select in 3D:** Click any mesh in the viewport to select its node.
- **Manipulate:** Use the toolbar (or hotkeys below) to **Move / Rotate / Scale** the selected node.
- **Inspector:** Edit **Position / Rotation / Scale** numerically. **Reset** returns TRS to defaults.
- **Zoom to node:** Double-click a row in the tree.
- **Autosave:** Scene is saved to LocalStorage after edits (500 ms debounce). Refresh to restore.

### Hotkeys
- **Q**: View/hand (hide gizmo, pan/rotate with mouse)
- **W**: Move
- **E**: Rotate
- **R**: Scale

## Getting started

> All commands below run inside **`frontend/`**.

### Prerequisites
- Node **18+** (LTS recommended)
- npm or pnpm (commands use npm)

### Install
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### Run
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Build & local preview
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Open the printed URL (typically http://localhost:5173)

## Testing

There‚Äôs a small script to exercise the pure ‚Äúmodel‚Äù functions (create, add, update, delete, reparent, reorder) without the UI:

File: frontend/src/tests/treeTest.ts

Run it with ts-node (one-time install shown below):
```bash
cd frontend
npx tsx src/tests/treeTest.ts
```
